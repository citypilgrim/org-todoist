#+title: org-todoist

A ~todoist~ integration with ~org-agenda~.

* Motivation
There are many existing emacs plugins for todoist. So why write a new one?

Packages like [[https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-todoist][emacs-todoist]] require interaction with a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] buffer in order to interact with a task, and has "Today" overlapping with project tasks, which would show repeated entries on ~org-agenda~.

While packages like [[https://github.com/ttakamura/org-todoist][org-todoist]] which parses org files utilise third party dependencies like ruby or python.

I'm seeking to build a package with only elisp dependencies, that would synchronize tasks based on file saving operations.

* Development
** TODO filter out repeated tasks from inbox during pull
** TODO support section crud
** TODO support project crud
